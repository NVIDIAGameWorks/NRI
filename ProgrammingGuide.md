# NRI Programming Guide

NRI is an abstract render interface which provides a single interface to a set of implementations which translate NRI calls into graphics API calls.

Supported APIs:
- D3D11
- D3D12
- Vulkan

Supported platforms:
- Windows
- Linux
- Apple

Supported CPU architectures:
- x86
- ARM

NRI can be used as a *shared* or *static* library.

`Device` is an abstract logical device which allows the application to work with one or more physical devices.

`Command Buffer` is a list of commands for a physical device.

`Command Queue` is a queue of `Command Buffers` which are ready for execution on a physical device. A physical device may support multiple queue types, queues of different types are processed in parallel by the physical device.

`Fence` is a synchronization primitive which allows the application:
- to synchronize execution of `Command Buffers` between `Command Queues`
- to wait for a physical device to complete execution of command buffers

`Command Allocator` is a memory allocator for command recording. When the application records commands into `Command Buffer`, memory for the commands is allocated from `Command Allocator` associated with the `Command Buffer`.

`Buffer` is a resource which represents a continuous range of items or memory.

`Texture` is a resource which represents a multidimensional array of pixels.

`Memory` is a physical device memory, `Buffers` and `Textures` must be bound to `Memory` before they can be accessed.

`Descriptor` is a texture view, buffer view or sampler.

`Descriptor Set` is a set of descriptors which can be accessed by a shader.

`Descriptor Pool` is a pool of descriptors which allocates memory for `Descriptor Sets`.

`Frame Buffer` is a state object which contains information on color attachments, depth attachments and their usage.

`Pipeline Layout` is a state object which contains information on shader resources and pipeline stages.

`Pipeline` is a state object which contains information on pipeline state.

# Initialization

To start using NRI, the application needs to create a device. The NRI device can be created using an existing graphics API device or without it:

1. to create an NRI device from existing D3D11, D3D12 or Vulkan device
    * use a wrapping extension (`NRIWrapper*.h`)
2. to create an NRI driver without wrapping
    * use a device creation extension (`NRIDeviceCreation.h`)

## Creating device using Vulkan wrapping extension

`NRIWrapperVK.h` contains the following function:

```cpp
Result nriCreateDevice(const DeviceCreationVKDesc& deviceDesc, Device*& device)
```

The application must specify the following members of `DeviceCreationVKDesc`:
* `deviceDesc.vkInstance`
  * VkInstance handle
* `deviceDesc.vkDevice`
  * VkDevice handle
* `deviceDesc.vkPhysicalDevices`
  * an array of VkPhysicalDevice handles
* `deviceDesc.deviceGroupSize`
  * the number of physical devices in the device group (the number of VkPhysicalDevice handles)
* `deviceDesc.queueFamilyIndices`
  * an array of queue family indices which were enabled on creation of the Vulkan logical device
* `deviceDesc.queueFamilyIndexNum`
  * The number of queue family indices

Other members of `DeviceCreationVKDesc` can be filled with zeros.

NRI library contains implementation of the `CreateDevice()` function.

## Creating device without wrapping

`NRIDeviceCreation.h` contains the following functions:

```cpp
Result nriEnumerateAdapters(AdapterDesc* adapterDescs, uint32_t& adapterDescNum)
```

The function allows the application to enumerate available adapters.

Valid usage:
* To get the number of adapters, the application can call the function with `adapterDescNum = 0`

Multithreading:
* No synchronization required

```cpp
Result nriCreateDevice(const DeviceCreationDesc& deviceCreationDesc, Device*& device)
```
* `deviceCreationDesc.adapter`
  * implementation will choose the first adapter if the value is nullptr
* `deviceCreationDesc.graphicsAPI`
  * controls which implementation will be used (D3D11, D3D12, VK)

Valid usage:
* The application can create any number of NRI devices using different implementations, there is no limitation on this

Multithreading:
* No synchronization required

## Destroying device

An NRI device must be explicitly destroyed to free memory and graphics API objects. NRI does not destroy D3D/VK objects passed to NRI via Wrapping Extension.

```cpp
void nriDestroyDevice(Device& device)
```

Valid usage:
* All NRI objects which were created using the device must be already destroyed

Multithreading:
* Access to device must be externally synchronized

# Querying interfaces

To get NRI interface, the application can use the following function:

```cpp
Result nriGetInterface(const Device& device, const char* interfaceName, size_t interfaceSize, void* interfacePtr)
```
* `interfaceName`
  * The name of the interface C++ struct with `nri::` prefix

`NRI.h` defines a macro which can be used to get an interface name and interface size from a structure name:

```cpp
nri::nriGetInterface(*m_Device, NRI_INTERFACE(nri::CoreInterface), (nri::CoreInterface*)&NRI)
```

# Core Interface

```cpp
const DeviceDesc& GetDeviceDesc(const Device& device)
```

Returns the device description which contains capabilities of the device and some info on the NRI implementation.

Multithreading:
* No synchronization required

```cpp
Result GetCommandQueue(Device& device, CommandQueueType commandQueueType, CommandQueue*& commandQueue)
```

Valid usage:
* The application can call this function to check which command queue types are supported

Multithreading:
* No synchronization required

```cpp
Result CreateCommandAllocator(const CommandQueue& commandQueue, uint32_t nodeMask, CommandAllocator*& commandAllocator)
```

Valid usage:
* nodeMask can be set to 0 (ALL_NODES) to create a command allocator which can be used with all physical devices in the device group

Multithreading:
* No synchronization required

```cpp
Result CreateDescriptorPool(Device& device, const DescriptorPoolDesc& descriptorPoolDesc, DescriptorPool*& descriptorPool)
```

Creates a descriptor pool which can be used to allocate descriptor sets.

If descriptorPoolDesc.nodeMask is set to 0 or has more than one bit set and the device group consists of more than one physical device, the maximum number of descriptors in the descriptor pool is multiplied by the number of physical devices.

Valid usage:
* The function may fail if the maximum number of descriptors exceeds the maximum size of D3D12 descriptor heap

Multithreading:
* No synchronization required

Result CreateBuffer(Device& device, const BufferDesc& bufferDesc, Buffer*& buffer)
```

For example, a pipeline layout can not be created for graphics and compute stages together, the application must create separate pipeline layouts pipelineLayoutDesc.stageMask must be a minimal set of pipeline stages which need access to shader resources.
* If the pipeline layout is used with a pipeline which has a vertex stage that needs access to vertex attributes, pipelineLayoutDesc.stageMask must include the vertex pipeline stage
